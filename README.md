# myBitmap

Working with images, conversions of Bitmap, Cursor or Icon, wpf included. This class is pure gold.

  Bitmap:
    BitmapSource to Drawing.Bitmap
    Drawing.Bitmap to BitmapSource
    merge two ImageSources to RenderTargetBitmap
    merge ImageSource and URI to RenderTargetBitmap
  
  Cursor:
    DrawingImage to Cursor
    Drawing.Icon to Cursor
    IO.Stream to Cursor
    URI to Cursor
    BitmapImage to Curosr
  
  Icon:
    Drawing.Icon to ImageSource
    URI to Drawing.Icon
    URI to ImageSource

I would like to pass on my experience in VB.Net to others and thus support this language for future generations. There are difficult beginnings in any programming language, when you have to learn to use new language libraries so that you can take even the smallest step. I want to help you with that now. You're welcome, signed Zdeněk Jantač.
